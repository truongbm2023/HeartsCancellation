# Vision 

Our vision as BGA Team 2 is to have a fully developed game on the Board Games Arena platform. Board Game Arena houses a bunch of table-top games which can be played virtually anywhere. You can play on BGA from your house, school, or even from the bathroom. Our vision as a team is to push a game that we, a development team have developed, onto the gaming platform for all to see, and for all to enjoy.

 In short: 
- We want to create games
- People enjoy games



# Mission 

Our mission as BGA Team 2 is to create a fully developed, fully polished table-top board game known as **Hearts Cancellation**. This is a variation of hearts that can revolve around **two decks** not one and can play to up to **six players**. Comparing this variation with the original Hearts card game, Hearts cancellation was created to bring double the deck, and half as more players, resulting in double the fun. 

Our mission as a development team is to:

- Fully develope Hearts Cancellation
- Pass Alpah testing (open to fellow devs)
- Pass Beta testing (open to all)



# Success Criteria 

Our success Criteria determines on **time**. Time is a huge and important factor when it comes to success of this project.

Success Criteria: 
- It takes time to pass Beta and Alpha stage 
- It takes time to code
- We only have a less than a year to finish
- Deadlines come up fairly quickly on the this project 
- Triple As level studios also struggle with deadlines, learn from their mistakes 

# Project Challenges

One of our challenges is understanding the Board Game Arena framework. We as a team, are not very familiar with how the framework, works. Things such as? 
- How does php work?
- How does the built in framework packages work? 
- How do we nagivate BGA?
- How do we nagivate BGA studios? 
- How does the framework, work?
